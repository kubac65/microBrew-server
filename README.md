# microBrew-server
> Homebrew done the smart way

Brewing beer at home is a really cool hobby. Sometimes, it can be a bit tedious, but nothing can compete with the taste of the beer that you brewed yourself.

To help myself with this task, I'm building a **microBrew** suite that will help me to automate some of the tasks, and hopefully make the whole process a bit easier.

This project containe the source code for the server used for temperature monitoring and heating element control. It communicates with **microBrew-controller** using very simple text based protocol.
